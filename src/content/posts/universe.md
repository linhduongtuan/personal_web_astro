## The Expanding Universe

The universe is constantly expanding, a discovery that has profound implications for our understanding of cosmology. This expansion is driven by dark energy, a mysterious force that makes up about 68% of the universe.

### Hubble's Law

Hubble's Law states that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from us. This observation supports the theory of an expanding universe.
